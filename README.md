# KeyCortex
A Secure Rust based digital wallet and cryptographic signing engine that binds enterprise identies to blockchain keys and executes policy-approved transactions.

KeyCortex is designed with an extensible multi-chain architecture, while the initial implementation supports only FlowCortex with PROOF (native coin) and FloweR (native stablecoin).
